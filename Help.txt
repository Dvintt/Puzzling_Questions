    Answer: to create is to inspire

    Reason: The question ask you the uesless sentence of the day.
           If you have noticed already, there are "useless words"
           scatter throughout the quiz. If you were paying 
           attention, the words are found in questions :
                       2 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 14
           Togather this makes : to create is to inspire


Question 14
   Answer: 14

   Reason: The question gives you a hint. "The last two digits
          one of the numbers below and the mystery number". It
          also says that the guy "dropped" the codes somewhere.
          The only numbers that are not in the code pad is the 
          question number itself.

         Cape-cobra   Pelican    hamster
              5            6           7


Question 12
   Answer: a) Give the world a snickers

   Reason: In this question, treat the world like a person. If
          you want to end someone's hunger, give them something
          to eat. In this case a snickers. 


Question 11
    Answer: b) Search
   
    Reason: This question is a reference to the Google logo. The
           letters on the logo are colored in order from
            Blue , Red , Orange , Blue , Green, and Red.


Question 10
   Anwser: infront of you
  
   Reason: Don't think too hard on this one. Look at the hint given
          to you
            
           "The answer to this question is " : infront of you .


Question 9
   Answer: c) 8

   Reason: If you look closely at row 6, you can see an 8 that is
          surrounded by the characters "&".


Question 8:
   Answer: a) Paused it
  
   Reason: This question is a reference to youtube videos. There are
          times where we need to pause the video because our internet
          is slow. We would normally see two bars near the bottem of 
          the video, RED and GRAY. Most of the time, we let the GRAY
          bar load up so we can watch the video without distraction.
           The only way we can do this is by "Pausing" the video. 


Question 7:
   Answer: d) UJXBFS

   Reason: If you look closely at the answer, you can see that each
         letter is a letter before the letters shown in the question.
                                 U -> V
                                 J -> K
                                 X -> Y
                                 B -> C
                                 G -> F
                                 S -> T 



Question 6: 
   Answer: a) Above the elbows

   Reason: This question wasn't actually talking about literal guns, 
          but an alternative term to the word "Muscles", which happen
          to be above the elbow(Biceps/Triceps).


Question 5: 
   Answer: r

   Reason: Pirate Pete actually gives you a hint in this question. 
         Noticed how he just says "ARRRRGHHH"? the answer to this
         question is "r" because "ARRRGHHH" sounds like the letter
         "r"


Question 4: 
   Answer: b) be with you

   Reason:  This question is a reference to the popular quote from
          "Star Wars", " May the force be with you".


Question 3:
   Answer: c) Primary

   Reason: This question is actually asking about the voting process 
         in America. we first have the PRIMARY and then we have the
         GENERAL vote. 
            If we were to put general in a military perspective, a, b
         are wrong because a and b are ranks that are from another
         branch, while d is a political/military position.



Question 2:
   Answer: d) 5

   Reason: The question ask how many holes in the statement 
                          "a hole in one"
                           1  2 3    4 5               
           Every letter that has a hole is counted. In this
          case there are 5 letters with a hole in them.



Question 1:
  Answer:  c) 317

  Reason:  The question itself was actually asking 17 + 300 =
                      
                           1)     7 + 300 = 
                               17+300=17
